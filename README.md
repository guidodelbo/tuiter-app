# Tuiter App

## Reference implementation

This is a variant of the reference implementation of the sample application from
[_Ruby on Rails Tutorial:
Learn Web Development with Rails_](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
(6th Edition)
by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Getting started

To get started with the app, first follow the setup steps in [Section 1.1 Up and running](https://www.railstutorial.org/book#sec-up_and_running).

Next, clone the repo and `cd` into the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/guidodelbo/tuiter_app.git
$ cd tuiter_app
```

Also make sure you’re using a compatible version of Node.js:

```
$ nvm install 16.13.0
$ node -v
v16.13.0
```

Then install the needed packages (while skipping any Ruby gems needed only in production):

```
$ yarn add jquery@3.5.1 bootstrap@3.4.1
$ gem install bundler -v 2.2.17
$ bundle _2.2.17_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _2.2.17_ install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you’ll be ready to seed the database with sample users and run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails db:seed
$ rails server
```

Follow the instructions in [Section 1.2.2 `rails server`](https://www.railstutorial.org/book#sec-rails_server) to view the app. You can then register a new user or log in as the sample administrative user with the email ` ` and password ` `.
