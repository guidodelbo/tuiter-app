The **Tuiter App** is an open-source, feature-rich, Twitter-like social media platform.

It's built with **Ruby on Rails** and serves as a project for **learning purposes**, **testing new technologies**, and **showcasing Rails development practices**. Contributions are welcome to improve and expand the app further.

- **Microposts**: Create, read and delete short posts (like tweets) with optional image attachments.
- **Image upload**: Supports image uploads using Active Storage and AWS S3.
- **Follow system**: Users have a feed of microposts from the people they are following.

## Purpose and Progress üõ§Ô∏è

This application was initially inspired by the [_Ruby on Rails Tutorial_](https://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

As an **open-source project** and **continuous work in progress**, it has been evolving with several improvements so far:
- Updated to Rails 8.0.1 and Ruby 3.4.2
- Replaced Minitest with RSpec for improved testing
- Added FactoryBot for better test data management
- Added Stimulus.js for modern JavaScript functionality
- Integrated Mailgun for production email delivery
- Configured AWS S3 for image storage in production

More improvements are planned and contributions are always welcome! Check the Issues tab for planned features or suggest your own.
