## About the App üöÄ

The **Tuiter App** is an open-source, feature-rich, Twitter-like social media platform.

It's built with **Ruby on Rails** and serves as a project for **learning purposes**, **testing new technologies**, and **showcasing Rails development practices**. Contributions are welcome to improve and expand the app further.

### Key Features üåü

- **User registration and authentication**: Secure account creation, login, logout, and session remembering for persistent sessions.
- **Account activation**: New users receive an email with a link to activate their account using a secure token.
- **Password reset**: Users can reset their forgotten passwords through a secure, email-based process.
- **Microposts**: Create, read and delete short posts (like tweets) with optional image attachments.
- **Image upload**: Supports image uploads using Active Storage and AWS S3.
- **Follow system**: Users have a feed of microposts from the people they are following.
- **Modern JavaScript**: Uses Stimulus.js for dynamic features.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive RSpec test suite including system, request, and unit tests.
- **Dockerized**: Application runs in Docker containers for consistency across environments.
- **Kamal Deployment**: Easy deployment to AWS EC2 using Kamal.

### Running Tests üß™

```

To run specific test files:
```sh
> bin/rspec spec/system/microposts/feed_spec.rb
```

## Purpose and Progress üõ§Ô∏è

This application was initially inspired by the [_Ruby on Rails Tutorial_](https://www.railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://www.michaelhartl.com/).

As an **open-source project** and **continuous work in progress**, it has been evolving with several improvements so far:
- Updated to Rails 8.0.1 and Ruby 3.4.2
- Replaced Minitest with RSpec for improved testing
- Added FactoryBot for better test data management
- Added Stimulus.js for modern JavaScript functionality
- Integrated Mailgun for production email delivery
- Configured AWS S3 for image storage in production
- Migrated from Heroku to AWS EC2 using Docker and Kamal
- Added SSL support with Let's Encrypt

More improvements are planned and contributions are always welcome! Check the Issues tab for planned features or suggest your own.
