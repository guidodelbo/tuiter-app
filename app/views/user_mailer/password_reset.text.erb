Hi <%= @user.name %>,

You recently requested to reset your Tuiter password.

To do so, click on the link below or copy and paste it into your browser:

<%= edit_password_reset_url(@user.reset_token, email: @user.email) %>

This link will expire in two hours.

If you didn't request a password reset, you can safely ignore this email and your password will stay as it is.

Thank you,
